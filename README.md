### I'm Edward, a University of Bristol Undergraduate with a love for flood inundation models and coding (in R!)

#### I'm currently in my final year, working on my dissertation (you can find a repository of my progress here on my profile github.com/EJPullen/dissertation) 
#### along with units on Geographic Data Science and Environmental Risks (you can find a repository for a nice little graph I made for this unit on my profile github.com/EJPullen/Idai-Emergency)
